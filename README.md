# FizzBuzz

My current rendition of the popular FizzBuzz test.

I'm happy at how short it is, and also that I only use pure C# to solve the problem. No usings except for `System.Console`.

I would like to make the match function more readable.

The object of the FizzBuzz game is to count up from 1, replacing the current iteration's number with Fizz if it is evenly divisible by 3, Buzz for 5, and FizzBuzz if both.
